## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi, I am master student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China. I received my B.S. degree in
computer science and technology in 2016 from Henan University, China.

## Research Interest

My recent study focuses on *knowledge graph representation learning*, and aims to elaborately apply some *deep learning* methods, e.g., ResNet and RNNs, on it.
But currently, I would like to learn more algorithms and theroies about *machine learning*.
