## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi, I am Lingbing. I received my B.S. degree in
Computer Science and Technology in 2016 at Henan University, and M.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2019 at  Nanjing University.

## Research Interest

My previous study focuses on *knowledge graph representation learning*, and aims to elaborately apply some *deep learning* methods, e.g., ResNet and RNNs, on it.
Currently, I would like to exploit the methodlogy of unsupervised and open knowledge graph embedding.
